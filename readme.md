# **AutoCorrect Fails – When Texting Goes Wrong**  

## **📌 Project Overview**  
AutoCorrect can be a lifesaver—or an absolute disaster. This project is a fun, interactive web platform where users can share their funniest, most embarrassing, or confusing auto-correct fails. Users can upload screenshots, vote for the best fails, and even play a “Guess the Original Message” game. The goal is to create a crowdsourced list of the most ridiculous texting mishaps caused by overenthusiastic auto-correct.  

## **🚀 Features**  
✅ **User Authentication** – Users can sign up, log in, and submit auto-correct fails.  
✅ **Post Your Fail** – Upload a screenshot or type out an auto-correct fail.  
✅ **Voting System** – Upvote the funniest fails.  
✅ **Leaderboard** – See the top fails of the week/month.  
✅ **Comment & React** – Users can discuss the best fails.  
✅ **"Guess the Original Message" Game** – Try to figure out what the original message was supposed to say.  
✅ **AI-Generated Fun Captions (Optional)** – AI generates funny descriptions for each fail.
